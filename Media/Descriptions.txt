Made in 72 hours for the Ludum Dare 50 jam.

I recommend you to just go play the game before reading any of this. If you get stuck or don't understand the controls, come back to read.

Command your tank and defeat every enemy to clear the levels.

The game was made almost completely from scratch, and I was planning to submit it to the Compo but missed the deadline, and then I remembered Reddit's favorite quote:
"A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad."

Features
- Command a tank.
- Go back and forth in time to get the best outcome. Delay your victory to ensure it.
- The time traveling can even be used to roll-back bugged enemies, as they sometimes can clip though walls.
- Four action-packed levels.
- Clean graphics.
- A fully-functional main menu.
- A lot of fun.

Missing or incomplete:
- I wanted to compose my own music and sound effects, but I just didn't had enough time.
- UI sounds are not implemented.
- Scene transitions.
- Animation smoothing.
- More levels.
- More enemy types.
- I'll replace the downloaded assets (textures, sounds, music) with my own and keep building over this. I think an expanded version of this game would work pretty well as a casual mobile game.

Development tools and stuff to note:
- Unity with Zenject and UniTask as the main framework.
- I built a deterministic simulator for the levels so that I could achieve the time traveling. This was an amazing learning experience that I will try to use to develop strategy games in the future.
- Probuilder for the level geometry.
- All of the graphic design, UI and some textures were made with Inkscape, and GIMP as an auxiliary tool.
- Blender for the single 3D model: the tank.
- A ton of Italo Disco and coffee during development to keep me awake.
